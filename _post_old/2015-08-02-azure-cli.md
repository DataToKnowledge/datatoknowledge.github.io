The Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows provides a set of open source, cross-platform commands for working with the Azure Platform. The Azure CLI provides much of the same functionality found in the Azure Management Portal, such as the ability to manage websites, virtual machines, mobile services, SQL Database and other services provided by the Azure platform.

The Azure CLI is written in JavaScript, and requires Node.js. It is implemented using the Azure SDK for Node.js, and released under an Apache 2.0 license. The project repository is located at [github](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-tools-xplat).

It requires that you install the [azure cli](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/). Please read the documentation before to start. Here we present a short tutorial

1.	how to install the azure cli
2.	how to connect your azure subscription from the azure cli
3.	how to use the Azure CLI

Install the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows
-------------------------------------------------

Install Node.js

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
$ sudo apt-get install npm
{% endhighlight %}

if you have a Mac you can use Brew.io

Use the following command to install the Azure CLI:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo npm install -g azure-cli
{% endhighlight %}


## How to connect to your Azure subscription

The complete doc is at the following [link](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-connect/). Here we use the credentials already downloaded

Unzip the folder [credential.zip](./data/credential.zip). In this folder there are all the subscriptions that we need to import in order to access via command line to azure.

Run the import command

{% highlight bash %}
azure account import <path to your *.publishsettings file>
{% endhighlight %}

Now if you run the command

```
azure account list
```

to obtain a result like this

{% highlight bash %}
info:    Executing command account list
data:    Name              Id                                    Current
data:    ----------------  ------------------------------------  -------
data:    Azure-sub-1       ####################################  true
data:    Azure-sub-2       ####################################  false
{% endhighlight %}

### how to use the Azure CLI

As everything should be in real life all the commands of the azure cli can be accessed by typing:

{% highlight bash %}
azure --help
{% endhighlight %}

that produces

{% highlight bash %}
info:             _    _____   _ ___ ___
info:            /_\  |_  / | | | _ \ __|
info:      _ ___/ _ \__/ /| |_| |   / _|___ _ _
info:    (___  /_/ \_\/___|\___/|_|_\___| _____)
info:       (_______ _ _)         _ ______ _)_ _
info:              (______________ _ )   (___ _ _)
info:
info:    Microsoft Azure: Microsoft's Cloud Platform
info:
info:    Tool version 0.8.17
help:
help:    Display help for a given command
help:      help [options] [command]
help:
help:    Log in to an Azure subscription using Active Directory. Currently, the user can login only via Microsoft organizational account
help:      login [options]

all the commands
.......

.....
{% endhighlight %}

### Account Management

1.	To view the subscription imported

{% highlight bash %}
azure account list
{% endhighlight %}

1.	To set a subscription

{% highlight bash %}
azure account set <subscription long id>
{% endhighlight %}

### Other commands

Apart the [complete tutorial of the commands](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/)

we are interested in

1.	listing VMs
2.	creating VMs
3.	deleting VMs
4.	open tcp ports
5.	close tcp ports

##[Azure CLI basic commands](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/)

Azure CLI can be accessed as single subscription or as resource group.

ASM: Individual resources, which are user-managed entities such as a database server, database, or website. This is the default mode of operation for the Azure CLI, and is referred to as Azure Service Management. However, when you have a complex solution that consists of multiple resources, it is useful to be able to manage the entire solution as a single unit.

ARM: To support managing a group of resources as a single logical unit, or resource group, we have introduced a preview of the Resource Manager as a new way of managing Azure resources.

The Azure CLI defaults to Azure Service Management mode. To switch to Resource Manager mode, use the following to enable command:

{% highlight bash %}
azure config mode arm
{% endhighlight %}

To change back to Azure service management mode, use the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
azure config mode asm
{% endhighlight %}

## Working with ASM

The complete list of the capabilities are described in the [doc](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/). Here we analyze the following commands.

**REMEMBER TO SET THE SUBSCRIPTION**

{% highlight bash %}
azure account list
azure account set <name>
{% endhighlight %}

### 1. listing VMs

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm list
{% endhighlight %}

### 2. creating VMs

> Before creating a VM we need to setup an key pair access. Follow the documentation [Create Key-Pair](2. Key Management.md) and [Convert rsa key to pem](2. Key Management.md).

In the following there is the a base template command to build a vm. Please run *azure vm creare --help* to see to the help and refer to the [doc for virtual machine in command line](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-command-line-tools/)

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm create <vm name> b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_2-LTS-amd64-server-20150506-en-us-30GB \
-g "dtk" \
-l "West Europe" \
-z "Standard_D2" \
-e 55555 \
-t "id_rsa.pem" \
-P \
-s 5406f2ec-2ed7-4f6r6-b31c-c0aee6ea0c2ba0a
{% endhighlight %}

The *id_rsa.pem* should point to a valid file. It's probabilty better to move into your .ssh directory (`$ cd ~/.ssh`) before execute the above command.

#### 3. deleting VMs

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm delete <vm name>
{% endhighlight %}

Moreover, we have commands to restart, shutdown and capture vms

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm restart <vm-name>
azure vm shutdown <vm-name>
azure vm capture <vm-name> <image-name>
{% endhighlight %}

#### 4. open tcp ports

To open a single port through the network

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm endpoint create <vm-name> -n <Port Name> <External Port> <Internal Port>
{% endhighlight %}

To open a range of ports

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm endpoint create-multiple <vm-name> <lb-port>[:<vm-port>[:<protocol>[:<enable-direct-server-return>[:<lb-set-name>[:<probe-protocol>[:<probe-port>[:<probe-path>[:<internal-lb-name>]]]]]]]] {1-*}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 5. close tcp ports

{% highlight bash %}
azure vm endpoint delete <vm-name> <Port Name>
{% endhighlight %}
